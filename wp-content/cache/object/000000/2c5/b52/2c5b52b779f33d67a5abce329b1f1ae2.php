<h2>The Recruiting Process is Important and Deserves Your Dedicated Focus</h2>
Today, there are plenty of articles, websites and blogs providing advice and best practices to high school athletes and their parents, helping them in the recruiting process with the ultimate goal of playing their sport at the college level.

Most of these articles provide valuable information including: NCAA guidelines, core courses needed, building a list of schools, contacting coaches, creating a video, etc. that every athlete aspiring to play college should know. This guide is different because I dig a little deeper and describe specifically the attention to detail, aggressiveness and persistence (albeit with a tremendous level of respect and professionalism) you need to not only get the chance to be recruited by a school of your choice but to also give you more opportunity and leverage to get the best offer possible. Your recruiting process is very important and needs dedicated time, planning, research and execution every step of the way â€“ <strong>the same level of dedication you put into your sport and school work.</strong> If YOU are dedicated to this process, college coaches WILL take notice. (Although there are some great recruiting agencies that may have your interests at heart) NO ONE can provide the time, effort and passion needed to give you more options and opportunity to be recruited than YOU.

Selecting the right college and team is extremely important. In some ways it will, either directly or indirectly, dictate your career options, the network and friends you build, where you may live, and your success long term. This process can also be stressful on families as well: You want very badly to play the sport you love at the college you want and your parents want what is best for you. Trying to attain this can be difficult so I want to provide some action items to focus more on DOING and less on WORRYING.

You should see this process as a great opportunity. If you consistently keep a positive mindset and implement the strategies provided, you WILL differentiate yourself from other potential recruits and give yourself a better chance in receiving your ideal offer. The coaches WANT to see young athletes be pro-active in this process. Give them what they want, have fun with it and seize the opportunity.
