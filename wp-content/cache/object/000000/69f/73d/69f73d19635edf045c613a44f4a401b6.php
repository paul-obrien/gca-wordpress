<h2>Utilizing YouTube: Highlight Athletic Ability and Character With Video</h2>
YouTube and video are very important in your strategy to be recruited. Why? They are a great tool to help grab a coach‚Äôs attention and get them to engage with you. This engagement could be a phone call, a meeting, a school visit, letting them know you will be attending their camp, anything that gives you a next step and more exposure to the coach and program.

</blockquote>
&nbsp;

Why use YouTube? First, after you upload a video to YouTube, a link is created to access that specific video and you will also be provided a link of all videos within your YouTube channel. This is very valuable within your email strategy, which I will describe later. You will be able to send these coaches a link to your video(s) or YouTube Channel. Now a coach is one click away from seeing you in action and getting a better understanding of what you can do as a player. Also, there is a greater probability of a coach clicking on a link to a video rather than getting a packet in the mail, opening it and inserting the video into his or hers computer or DVD player. Many of those packets sit in coach‚Äôs offices and never get opened. That‚Äôs a fact. <strong>Another reason for utilizing YouTube and creating your own channel is that you can upload multiple videos giving coaches one central place to click thru and watch all of your videos.</strong> Finally, YouTube videos can be easily integrated into web pages. For example, you could easily embed your YouTube recruiting videos on:

&nbsp;
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">‚Ä¢ A recruiting profile page you have set up</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">‚Ä¢ Your Facebook page</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">‚Ä¢ A personal website</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">‚Ä¢ Your high schools sports website</p>
&nbsp;

In short, the purpose of utilizing YouTube is to make it easy for the coaches to view your videos and give you a better chance to be noticed.
