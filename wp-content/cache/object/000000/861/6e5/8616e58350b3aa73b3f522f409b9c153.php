<p style="text-align: justify;">The creation of GCA was inspired by the incredible experiences that the <a title="Bio Page" href="http://www.goalcollegeathlete.com/about/bio-page" target="_blank">two founders</a> had while playing college sports and the positive effect that it has had on their lives post-college from a personal, social and professional standpoint. They want to motivate young athletes by giving them a vision of the future so they can better prepare to reach their GOAL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To help create this vision GCA:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Conducts a continuous research study directly asking current college coaches</strong> in all sports what they look for in potential student athletes in order to be successful in a college program. <strong>The coachâ€™s thoughtful and relevant responses are recorded in our</strong> <a title="Coachâ€™s Advice" href="http://www.goalcollegeathlete.com/coach-advice" target="_blank">Coachâ€™s Advice</a>Â pages. GCA believes the responses will give young athletes perspectives that they might be overlooking, therefore motivating them to <strong>put more emphasis on the qualities that coaches are truly looking for</strong> â€“ ultimately helping them to reach their GOAL of playing college sports.</li>
</ul>

	<li><strong>Created a Complementary Guide <a title="Student-Athlete Guide to be Recruited" href="http://www.goalcollegeathlete.com/student-athlete-guide-to-be-recruited/" target="_blank">(Student-Athlete Guide to be Recruited)</a> which provides in-depth strategies and a step-by-step plan</strong> to help young athletes <strong>attract college coachesâ€™ attention, engage with them </strong>and<strong> get on more recruiting lists</strong>. We feel if young athletes can be successful doing this with multiple coaches and schools, the chances of getting the best offer possible and finding the school that fits best for THEM greatly increases.</li>
