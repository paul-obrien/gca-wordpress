<h2>The Best Time to Send Emails to Coaches</h2>
You are putting all of this effort into creating relevant, attention-grabbing emails to send to coaches. You should also be strategic in when you send these emails. This is important. Think about it. I have asked coaches when they most frequently get emails from athletes trying to be recruited. Overall, they say mostly nights and weekends are when they receive most of their emails from potential recruits. Don‚Äôt be like most of these athletes trying to get attention: They are emailing the coach when they (the athlete) are free, i.e. when it is best for them, not the coach. I go back to it‚Äôs about THEM, not about YOU. <strong>Think about the Coach‚Äôs schedule.</strong> During the week, most coaches practice (or have a game or event) in the afternoon. In the evening, they do look at email but they also spend a lot of time speaking with potential recruits, parents and high school coaches among other things. On the weekends is when most sports have games/events and this is usually an all day affair for a coach and team (especially if they are the away team and are travelling). Also, coaches have lives outside of their sport. They are human beings just like the rest of us and spend time with their families, friends, husbands, wives, girlfriends and boyfriends, usually on the weekends. After taking this into consideration, the majority of coaches (not all) are sitting at their desk between 9:30am and lunchtime going through their emails, recruiting, putting practice plans together, watching video, etc. This is probably the best time to send your email. <strong>Why?:</strong>

&nbsp;
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">‚Ä¢ <strong>They are most likely sitting at their desk in front of their laptop/computer</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>‚Ä¢ They are not ‚Äúon the go‚Äù so they are settled and have a bit more time</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>‚Ä¢ The majority of other potential recruits/young athletes are not sending their emails at this time</strong></p>
&nbsp;

You might be saying ‚ÄúI am at school, I don‚Äôt have the time to send emails on weekday mornings‚Äù? There is a couple of ways around this. After you draft your emails, you can have them scheduled to be sent out at a time that you choose, preferably for coaches between <strong>9:30am-10:30am</strong>. There are services like Boomerang for Gmail, which is a plugin/extension you can download for free to make this very simple. Second, if you have a study hall or gym class in the morning maybe you could explain to your teacher what you are trying to accomplish and that you would like to spend the class time sending out emails to universities you would possibly like to attend. This is a reasonable request, I would think most teachers would understand. I would have the emails drafted completely so you are just sending emails and not editing and writing during this limited time.

&nbsp;

I have another piece of advice when it comes to sending emails to coaches. Make sure to check their game/event schedules (you can find them on the school‚Äôs athletic website). I would recommend <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span> sending a coach an email on a game day. Coaches are pre-occupied focusing on the game that day and getting their team as prepared as possible. Also, they might be playing an away game and have a road trip giving them even less time. Overall, most coaches are not focused on recruiting the day of a game/event, they are focused on their current team and I don‚Äôt suggest emailing or calling them on these days. You should also be checking when their season is over. For the most part, the few weeks after the season the coaches are probably going to try to take their mind off of the sport and if they do any recruiting, it will probably be with recruits they have already been in contact with and have pre-scheduled calls and meetings. This is my opinion and will be different from coach to coach, I just want you to spend your time and energy at the right time to give you the best possible chance of a response.
